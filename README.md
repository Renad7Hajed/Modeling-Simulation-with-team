# Modeling and Simulation of products Flow at Taif national dairy factory

Each factory has production problems, which may be a reason for delaying the production of the product or even destroying the product and causing a loss of those resources and thus leads to a deterioration in the quality of service for those factories. 

Taif National Dairy Factory is one of those factories that need a study to reduce the expected problems above And by using simulation programs, this will help us in dealing with the entities (products) and knowing the procedures that will reduce those problems.

Therefore, this study reviews the modeling and simulation of products in Taif National Dairy Factory. This study is for the course (Industrial Systems Simulation- Taif University), was completed by a team consisting of 7 members.
